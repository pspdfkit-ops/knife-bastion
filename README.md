[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/eligible/knife-bastion/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/eligible/knife-bastion)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/knife-bastion.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/knife-bastion)

This plugin allows Knife to access Chef server over a secure SSH connection,
without exposing Chef server port to your VPN network.

## Installation

If you're using ChefDK, install `knife-bastion` into the Chef omnibus:

```bash
chef gem install knife-bastion
```

If you're using rubygems to manage your Chef repository dependencies, add this line to your Chef repository's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'knife-bastion'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install knife-bastion

## Usage

Configure your bastion server in `.chef/knife.rb` (at the bottom):

```ruby
# ...
# your knife configurations goes here
# ...

# Bastion host SSH settings
knife[:bastion_host] = "bastion.mycorp.net"
knife[:bastion_user] = ENV["MYCORP_USER"] || ENV["CHEF_USER"] || ENV["USER"]

# If you have multiple networks, that require different MFA tokens, specify
# each network name here. (This configuration is referenced to clarify the
# token a user should employ.)
# knife[:bastion_network] = "mynet"

# By default, the proxy server is created on port 4443. You may configure the
# local bastion port here:
# knife[:bastion_local_port] = 4443

require "knife-bastion/activate"
```

Now, your workflow will look like this:

1. Run `knife bastion start` - this command will establish SSH connection to
   bastion box for 10 minutes, and create a SOCKS proxy on port `4443`, that
   will forward all Chef requests to Chef server via bastion box.
2. Use Chef to do your work.
3. At any time you can use `knife bastion status` - which will verify the proxy
   and make sure everything works as expected.
4. After you finished, run `knife bastion stop` to shutdown the connection
   and turn off the proxy. If you forget to do this, it will die automatically
   after 10 minutes.

Sometimes when you work on a big change, default timeout of 10 minutes is too short.
You can increase timeout with `--timeout` flag:

```
knife bastion start --timeout 1800
```

Maximum timeout is 3600 (1 hour) for security reasons. You can re-establish bastion
connection by executing `knife bastion start` (if the connection is currently active,
it will be forcibly closed.)

### Bastion troubleshooting

If something is not right, you need to ensure you have access to bastion box.
Try connecting to `bastion.mycorp.net` via SSH:

```bash
ssh ${MYCORP_USER-$USER}@bastion.mycorp.net
```

Check current bastion connection status (it will tell you if there is anything
wrong with your box):

```
knife bastion status
```

### Using knife-bastion Outside of Chef

This gem can be used to connect to any server utilizing generic
proxy client. The bastion should be started the same way as it is
described above.

Example:

```ruby
require 'knife-bastion/client_proxy'
require 'rest_client'

# initialize RestClient::Resource object and wrap it into a bastion proxy
api = KnifeBastion::ClientProxy.new(
  RestClient::Resource.new('https://domain.com/api/v1')
)

# use api the same way as it would be used as a RestClient::Resource
api['posts/1/comments'].post 'Good article.', content_type: 'text/plain'
```
